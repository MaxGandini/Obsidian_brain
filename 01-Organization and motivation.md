The idea of this vault is to order and leave a register of many advancements in studying the area of computation, involving [[Linux]], [[Bash]], [[nvim]] and more. There will be a folder with examples for each case, and structured summaries of different videos showcasing commands for easy access. 

Also, the latter is thought of as an environment that facilitates control over coding many projects in [[Python]] [[C]] and more. Adding to the general knowledge of [[programs]] [[API]] and [[Data-Science]] .

Finally, [[AI]] and [[Machine Learning]] will be a huge area of this vault. We will explore different models, mathematical concepts and code examples for each case.
