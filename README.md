# Philosophy

This vault serves many functions at the same time:

- It's main function is to force me to stop, write, and think over those things I think I understand. One of the worst vices in any mental endeavor is turning your brain off as soon as you find the first working answer. 
- Second, It's a register. It's all well connected and nested so that not only knowledge is easily accessible, but also the context in which I created it.
- Lastly, it serves as documentation of skills for my CV, ensuring that my soft skills are substantiated rather than vague claims, forming a solid backbone for it.
