A program is just a set of instructions that a computer can execute, and an “executable” is just a file that contains a program. The words “program” and “executable” are often used interchangeably. Broadly speaking, there are two types of programs:

- Compiled programs
- Interpreted programs
### Compiled vs interpreted:

A compiled program is a program that has been converted from human-readable source code into machine code (binary)

An interpreted program is a program that is executed by _another_ program. The program that executes the interpreted program is called an [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_%28computing%29). The interpreter reads the source code of the interpreted program and executes it.
