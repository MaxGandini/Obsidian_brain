A pipeline is a concept in programming that systematizes the application of different operations to a certain input data.
examples:
- [[pipeline.py]]
- [[linear_regression1.py]]

The image above is an oversimplification, and there are many ways to conceive this loop as a straight line with the loop in the middle. 
The main takeaway here, is that one can use an [[API]] like the one defined in [[Sci-Kit Learn]] to generate pipelines in a codebase. 

This way, users can get a diagramatical representation of the transformations applied to the input data, so any problem can be easily trackable.
