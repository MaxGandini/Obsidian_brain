The **Granger causality test** is a [statistical hypothesis test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing "Statistical hypothesis testing") for determining whether one [time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series "Time series") is useful in [forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting "Forecasting").[clive granger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clive_granger "clive granger") argued that [causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality "Causality") in [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics") could be tested for by measuring the ability to predict the future values of a time series using prior values of another time series.
