The shell is the command-line interpreter. It's a program that processes commands and outputs the results.
A good way to remember this, is that it's name comes from it being the "outer-most" part of the Kernel, and it serves as a mediator.

For example, if using ```wezterm``` you can type in the command line:
```wezterm -e python```
and a new terminal emulator window will pop up, with a command line interpreter (shell), which will be the python interpreter.
