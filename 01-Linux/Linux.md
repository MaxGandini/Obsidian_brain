Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the linux kernel. 
Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution which includes the Kernel and supporting system software and libraries. Many of which are provided by the [[GNU]] Project
By default, Linux uses [[Bash]] as it's shell for interacting with background processes. Generally, these processes are enhanced or run by systems applications contained in [[SystemD]] , which is a software suite that provides an array of system components for the OS.
