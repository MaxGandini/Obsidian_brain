It's an instance of artificial intelligence, which has the purpose to *generate* new original content based on images, text, music etc. 
It is used to classify and predict based on existing data, mimicking the pattern recognition and imagination process in a human.

These models typically use techniques like [[Neural Networks]], [[Tansformers]] and [[variational autoencoders]]. The transformers are the new hitter in the environment, and are behind the models like GPT-3 for text generation, DALL-E for image, DeepFake for video, etc.
