**Very important keynotes to remember:**
- Go in deep with the problematic: Gather metadata, speak with experts of the areas surrounding the data.
- Explore Data Consciously. Read the columns, investigate the meaning and plan in advance.
- Planify and Brainstorm. Write notes, investigate what other people did with similar problems.
- Focus on the question, understand the methods, measure the complexity of the problem.
