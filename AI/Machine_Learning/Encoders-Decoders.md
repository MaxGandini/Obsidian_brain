More examples coming (with code). 
## Encoder :

##### Function:
Encoders are designed to interpret and transform input data into a more abstract, often compressed representation. This is crucial in extracting meaningful patterns and features from the data.
##### Usage:
They are indispensable in fields like natural language processing, image recognition, and data compression. For instance, in NLP, they help with tasks like sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and topic modeling.
##### Process:
Encoders analyze the input data, which could be in various forms like text, images, or sound, and convert it into a dense, feature-rich vector. This vector encapsulates the essential information from the input in a format suitable for further processing or analysis.
##### Examples:
Beyond BERT, other notable examples include Convolutional Neural Networks [[CNN]] for image data and Recurrent Neural Networks [[RNN]] for sequential data like time series. 

## Decoder:

##### Function:
Decoders are designed to reconstruct or generate output data from an internal representation, effectively translating complex data structures into a more interpretable form.
##### Usage:
They find extensive use in language generation, image and video generation, and in transforming abstract data representations back into human-readable formats.
##### Process:
Starting from an internal representation, decoders reconstruct the original data or generate new, coherent output based on this representation. This process often involves complex algorithms to ensure the output is logical and contextually appropriate.
##### Examples:
Besides GPT models, other examples include Variational Autoencoders [[VAE]] and Generative Adversarial Networks [[GAN]] in image generation.
