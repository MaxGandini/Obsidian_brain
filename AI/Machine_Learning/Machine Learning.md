Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence [[AI]] concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks to surpass many previous approaches in performance.
Nowadays, the most mature environment for developing machine learning models is within the [[Python]] language. More specifically with the libraries [[pytorch]] [[tensorflow]] [[Sci-Kit Learn]] .

Some general features of machine learning models are:

- Parameters
It is the set of fitted parameters.

- Hyper Parameters
It is a parameter set by the scientist to guide the model to the right training.
