Backpropagation is an often misunderstood algorithm, it generally is mentioned in the context of neural networks within machine learning. It's an algorithm that can be used in the context of any optimization problem that involves a function with a set of undefined parameters and an array of points to which this function should adhere to.

A great explanation can be seen in the [[Artem_Kisanov]] video about this algorithm: (https://youtu.be/SmZmBKc7Lrs)
