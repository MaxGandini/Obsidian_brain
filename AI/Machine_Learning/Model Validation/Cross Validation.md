Cross validation is a method that addresses the many problems which could arise by random chance, when splitting a dataset mindlessly.

It consists in a test train split loop . You can imagine a dataset divided into the two train and test splits. But the division point is arbitrary, so one must choose from many different options. 
IE:

- [[KFold]]
- [[TimeSeriesSplit]]
- [[ShuffleSplit]]
