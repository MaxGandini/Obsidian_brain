It's a model that stands for Autoregressive integrated moving average. It's pretty self explanatory, but it's a model that generalizes autogressive moving average: ARMA(jaj).

It models non stationary series and periodic variation respectively. All these models are fitted to time series in order to better understand it an predict future values. 

Stationary series is a series which does not change it's expected value over time.
