A gradient Boosting Machine is an ensemble learning method. The learning comes in "stages"m and the [[Decision trees]] are built sequentially, attempting to correct the errors of it's predecessor.

This feature allows a GBM to capture subtle patterns and complex interactions. For example, for recognizing labeled subgroups and non linear relationships in the data.
