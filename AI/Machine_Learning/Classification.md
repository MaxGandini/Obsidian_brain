In the context of machine learning, classification consists in a set of statistical methods and algorithms to predict the category in which an object with certain attributes falls into.

- [[Logistic Regression]] is a classification model used for binary or multi-class classification. It is a regressor because it calculates probability which is a continuous variable in the mathematical model, but it predicts the probability to fall into a category.
- [[K-Nearest Neighbors]] 
- [[Support Vector Machine]] (SVM)
- [[Decision Tree Classifier]] [[Decision_trees]]
- [[Naive Bayes]]
