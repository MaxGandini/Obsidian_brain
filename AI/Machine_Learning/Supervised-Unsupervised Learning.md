- [[Supervised-Learning]]: 
We have a set of columns that we call features, and one column which we call target. Supervised models take the features in order to predict a target.

```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.2.6",
	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2024.10.30 - 14.30pm.writing"
}
```

- [[Unsupervised-Learning]]: 
Does not take any target as input, its all features, and the model predicts ways of categorizing the data. (In [[Sci-Kit Learn]] the target column is still there but as default: y=None , for API consistency)
