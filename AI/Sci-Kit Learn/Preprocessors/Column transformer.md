From the [[Sci-Kit Learn]] API: 
```class sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer(transformers, *, remainder='drop', sparse_threshold=0.3, n_jobs=None, transformer_weights=None, verbose=False, verbose_feature_names_out=True, force_int_remainder_cols=True)[source]
Applies transformers to columns of an array or pandas DataFrame.

This estimator allows different columns or column subsets of the input to be transformed separately and the features generated by each transformer will be concatenated to form a single feature space. This is useful for heterogeneous or columnar data, to combine several feature extraction mechanisms or transformations into a single transformer.
```

Fundamental [[Preprocessor]] for applying many different transformations. In example:
- [[Ordinal Enconder]]
- [[MinMaxScaler]]
