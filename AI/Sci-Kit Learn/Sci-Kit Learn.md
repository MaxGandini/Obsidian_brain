**Scikit-learn** is a widely used open-source machine learning library for [[Python]]. 
#### 1. [[Supervised-Learning]]
- [[Classification]]: Algorithms for predicting discrete labels .
- [[Regression]]: Techniques for predicting continuous outcomes .
#### 2. [[Unsupervised-Learning]]
- **Clustering**: Methods for grouping similar instances.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques to reduce the number of features while retaining essential information.
#### 3. [[Evaluation methods]]
- Tools for evaluating model performance using various metrics .
- Cross-validation methods to assess how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent dataset.
#### 4. [[Preprocessor]]
- Techniques for data preprocessing such as:
    - Normalization and standardization.
    - Encoding categorical features.
    - Handling missing values.
#### 5. [[Scikit-Pipeline]]
- The ability to create pipelines that streamline the process of transforming data and applying machine learning algorithms in a single step, ensuring reproducibility and cleaner code.
