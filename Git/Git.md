Github is a cloud-based platform to store share and work with others to write code.
You can showcase or share, track and manage, let other review the code and collaborate on a shared project without worrying that you changes will impact you collaborators.

- Create a branch from the main copy of files
- Make edits to independent files while managing your own personal branch
- Let Git **merge** intelligently your specific changes back into the main copy of files
- Git keeps track of you and other peoples changes
