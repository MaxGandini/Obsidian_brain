Generally:

- A checksum is generated by applying a specific [[Algorithm]] to the data.
- The value of the checksum is usually sent along with the data
- When the data is retrieved, the checksum is recalculated and the program checks that it matches the original. It assumes the data is intact.
- If the checksums do not match, it suggests the data has been altered or corrupt.
