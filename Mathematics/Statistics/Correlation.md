Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.

The correlation coefficient, $r$, is calculated as:

$$r=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\bar{y})^2}}$$

Where:
- $x_i,y_i$ are the data points.
- $\bar{x},\bar{y}$ are the means of $x$ and $y$.
- $n$ is the number of data points.

- $r\in[-1,1]$
- $r=1$: Perfect positive linear relationship.
- $r=-1$: Perfect negative linear relationship.
- $r=0$: No linear relationship.

1. **Positive Correlation**: As $x$ increases, $y$ tends to increase.
2. **Negative Correlation**: As $x$ increases, $y$ tends to decrease.
3. **No Correlation**: No clear relationship between $x$ and $y$.
