Covariance is a measure of how related the apparition of one variable is, to the apparition of another. 
So, more formally, it's a measure of the joint variability of two random variables.
$$ cov(x,y)=\sum_{n}{( x_{n}-x_{mean}) \left( y_{n}-y_{mean} \right)}$$
Another notation would be: ``
$${\displaystyle \operatorname {cov} (X,Y)=\operatorname {E} {{\big [}(X-\operatorname {E} [X])(Y-\operatorname {E} [Y]){\big ]}}}$$
Where $E[X]$ is the expected value of $X$ . Covariance is sometimes justly denoted as $\delta_{XY}$ .
