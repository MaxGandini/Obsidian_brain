Beginning AutoGluon training... Time limit = 600s
AutoGluon will save models to 'AutogluonModels/ag-20241004_112643'
=================== System Info ===================
AutoGluon Version:  1.1.1
Python Version:     3.10.12
Operating System:   Linux
Platform Machine:   x86_64

Setting presets to: best_quality

Fitting with arguments:
{'enable_ensemble': True,
 'eval_metric': RMSE,
 'freq': 'h',
 'hyperparameters': 'default',
 'known_covariates_names': ['event_day', 'day_of_week'],
 'num_val_windows': 50,
 'prediction_length': 216,
 'quantile_levels': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9],
 'random_seed': 1502,
 'refit_every_n_windows': 1,
 'refit_full': False,
 'skip_model_selection': False,
 'target': 'y',
 'time_limit': 600,
 'val_step_size': 96,
 'verbosity': 2}

Provided train_data has 2160 rows, 3 time series. Median time series length is 720 (min=720, max=720). 
Time series in train_data are too short for chosen num_val_windows=50. Reducing num_val_windows to 3.

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'y'
	known_covariates:
		categorical:        []
		continuous (float): ['event_day', 'day_of_week']
	past_covariates:
		categorical:        []
		continuous (float): ['temperature', 'rainfall']

To learn how to fix incorrectly inferred types, please see documentation for TimeSeriesPredictor.fit

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'RMSE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
