There are many methods in the `statsmodels.tsa` module for time series models validation. An example of usage in this library can be found at :

- [[arima_function.py]]

Some of the model validation techniques include:

- [[ACF]] Partial autocorrelation function
- [[ACF]] Autocorrelation function
- [[Granger-Causality]] It's a test which looks for causation between two different time series.
- [[CUSUM]] Detects structural breaks in a time series.

Some general measures are seen in [[Time Series]] validation:

- [[AIC]]
- [[BIC]]
