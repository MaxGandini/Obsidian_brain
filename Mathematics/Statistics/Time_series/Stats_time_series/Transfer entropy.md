This is a concept that's important to analyze non linear relationships between sets of time series. 
This will be based on the link :

#### Transfer Entropy between Communities in Complex Financial Networks

###### motivation: 

Complex systems present a large pallette of emerging phenomena which are difficult to capture with typical mathematical or even AI techniques. Specifically, measures like [[ACF]] or [[Granger-Causality]]  are limited in their interpretability.

ACF suffers from the fact that one cannot separate the effects caused by the very periodicity of the function and the environment. Granger causality can avoid this problem, but suffers from the same problem like ACF because it doesn't detect nonlinear transfers of information.

I directly copied the Theoretical introduction from the [[IDTxl]] library, which is insane at giving a [[Theoretical-Introduction]] .
