BigQuery is a fully managed, serverless data warehouse offered by google cloud that allows you to run SQL-like queries on large datasets. 
The syntax is specific, and provides advanced functionalities such as data processing and integration with google cloud services. 

- Using SQL in BigQuery
BigQuery uses a SQL dialect called Standard SQL, which is based on the SQL 2011 specification. It provides robust SQL features, such as:

	SELECT queries for data retrieval
	JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, etc.)
	Aggregation (GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)
	Window Functions (e.g., ROW_NUMBER(), RANK())
	Subqueries
	Data modification (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

- Connecting to BigQuery Using Python

Google provides a Python client for BigQuery (google-cloud-bigquery) that allows you to interact with BigQuery using SQL commands in your Python code.
