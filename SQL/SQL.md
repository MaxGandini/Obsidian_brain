SQL is a structured query language. It's the standard to manage and manipulate relational databases. 
It is used to create, read, update and delete data in a database.

Key operations:

- [[SELECT]]
- [[INSERT]]
- [[UPDATE]]
- [[DELETE]]
- [[CREATE]]
- [[DROP]]

In many cases, SQL is embedded within or used alongside a general-purpose programming language like [[Python]]. This is achieved with libraries like [[BigQuery]] or [[SQLITE]] for local databases.
