    "poly" means "many".
    "morph" means "to change" or "form".
	
Polymorphism in programming is the ability to present the same interface (function or method signatures) for many different underlying forms (data types).

A classic example is a `Shape` class that `Rectangle`, `Circle`, and `Triangle` can inherit from. With polymorphism, each of these classes will have different underlying data. The circle needs its center point coordinates and radius. The rectangle needs two coordinates for the top left and bottom right corners. The triangle needs coordinates for the corners.
